His vision extended far beyond mere trading, as he dreamed of building an industrial India that could compete on the global stage.\n\nJamsetji's business philosophy was revolutionary for its time. He believed in the principles of fair business practices, philanthropy, and nation-building through industry. These values continue to guide the Tata Group to this day.",

It was known for producing high-quality textiles that could compete with British imports.\n\nBeyond its commercial success, the Empress Mills was notable for its progressive labor practices. Jamsetji introduced worker welfare measures that were far ahead of their time, including provident fund schemes, gratuity payments, and accident compensation.",

He resolved to build a hotel that would welcome all people, regardless of race, color, or creed.\n\nThe Taj was the first building in Bombay to use electricity and American fans, the first to have Turkish baths, and the first to have German elevators. It quickly became a symbol of Indian wealth, enterprise, and hospitality.\n\nSadly, Jamsetji did not live to see his dream realized, as he passed away in 1904, shortly after the hotel's construction began. The hotel was completed by his son Dorabji Tata.",

The location was chosen for its proximity to iron ore, coal, and manganese deposits, as well as its access to water and transportation.\n\nTISCO began production in 1912 and was the first steel plant in India. It was also one of the few steel companies in the world to remain profitable during the Great Depression.\n\nThe establishment of TISCO was a monumental achievement, as it came at a time when experts, particularly from the colonial British government, were skeptical about India's ability to produce steel.

Microsoft didn't have an operating system at the time, so they acquired QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System) from Seattle Computer Products, modified it, and renamed it MS-DOS.\n\nThe deal with IBM was a masterstroke by Gates. Microsoft retained the rights to license MS-DOS to other computer manufacturers, which proved to be incredibly lucrative as the PC clone market exploded in the 1980s.\n\nMS-DOS was a command-line operating system, requiring users to type commands rather than use a graphical interface.

It was sold as a motherboard only—without a keyboard, monitor, case, or power supply—for $666.66.\n\nIn 1977, Apple was incorporated and released the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.
